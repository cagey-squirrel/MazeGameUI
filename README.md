# MazeGameUI
I decided to upgrade a MazeGame i wrote in C++ and make a UI for it in Python3. The mistake i made is i just tried to copy the code and modify it so it runs in Python and i could never get it to work so i sat down dig into the problem again and made a slightly different solution (mainly in way of graph representation). In short game consists of one Maze on form of a graph. User can add and delete obstacles by clicking on the screen with left and right click of the mouse. User sets starting point and exit, and by clicking on "Solve the maze" button user gets the program to find the shortest path from starting point to exit (if it exists). The path shows up as a red line connecting the dots. User is free to change the terrain and solve the maze as many times as needed and program will come up with a new solution for given task. Program uses Dijstra's algorithm for finding the shortest distance from start to end. All in all it was fun to visit this problem again and modifying the solution so it better serves its purpose. This experience opened up many roads to me, such as using it to guide a snake in my Snake game, and i cant wait to make more of it.
